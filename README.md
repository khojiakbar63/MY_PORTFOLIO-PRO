- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built using React, Next.js, and Express.js with MongoDB as the database.
- **Reusable Components**: Clean and modular code structure for easier maintenance and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, SCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Module Not Found**
   - Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
   - If you're using `react-icons`, make sure to include the correct import paths.

### 2. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Install missing type definitions:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev @types/node
     ```

### 3. **Build Errors on Vercel**
   - Double-check that all modules are included in `package.json`.
   - Ensure the correct Node.js version is specified in the `.nvmrc` file or Vercel settings.

## Roadmap

- Add new sections for projects and achievements.
- Improve performance and SEO.
